openSUSE 42.2 in dropdown of omnia webUI

lxc-start -F -n k2so

"Welcome to your new installation of openSUSE Leap 42.2!
Please configure a few basic system settings:"
Locale set to 131 - en_GB.UTF-8
set root password with passwd

#Errors out of the gate
auditd.service and systemd-modules-load.service fail by default, disable them
systemctl disable auditd.service
rm /usr/lib/modules-load.d/sg.conf

#Nice and clean
Gave k2so a static lease 32:57:60:10:58:23
Removed the mountpoint for /mnt/data from router - datadisk is 100% k2so's, not Omnias
zypper in --no-recommends salt-minion
echo "144.76.82.9 salt salt.rootco.de" >> /etc/hosts
hostnamectl set-hostname k2so.dyn.rootco.de
systemctl enable salt-minion
systemctl start salt-minion

#encrypt and configure disk
blocked by device not visible in lxc, fixed with container conf

Installing btrfsprogs,cryptsetup,snapper from salt state
Can't use YaST because it scans using btrfsprogs which causes a crash as lxc doesn't own it's root btrfs fs

DONE - little scripts on omnia to make sure LXC container is running and light up User1 accordingly
  Blue flashing - container booting - set by lxc start-script on omnia
    Done - /etc/lxc-bootnotify
  White - container booted - set by container after boot
    Done - /usr/local/sbin/backer-unlock
  Red flashing - container broken - set by a monitor script on omnia
    Done - /etc/lxc-alarm + cron

/etc/config/lxc-auto
  config container
        option name k2so
        option timeout 60

Profile.local to warn when /backups not mounted
  
DONE - proper decrypt method and/or script to decrypt with backer-unlock

TODO - as backups will be pushed from root user on obiwan and others generate root ssh private keys for all hosts in salt, and have those public keys on k2so via salt
TODO - create new users for backer on k2so, one for csync, rsync, use system root keys to auth to them, use command= to lock down each http://superuser.com/questions/261361/do-i-need-to-have-a-passphrase-for-my-ssh-rsa-key

TODO - backup script to create router config to obiwan/k2so
INVERT THE BELOW - was a pull just to be done quickly as keys hadn't been setup yet.
rsync -a --info=progress2 root@192.168.1.1:/etc/ etc
rsync -a --info=progress2 root@192.168.1.1:/srv/lxc lxc
TODO - restore script for router config
TODO - backup k2so + restore script
TODO - csync/rsync crons - csync of home takes a few minutes
TODO - set boot notify to work inside LXC container, not omnia, omnia won't work when rebooting container
