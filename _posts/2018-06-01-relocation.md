Here we are, the relocation is approaching and seems like my heart is breaking in two.

I'm leavig my country after 33 years full of memories, friends and expectations but my spirit is pushing me onwards, I'm ready to go, heading for the right way, knowing exactly just what to do.

It' time to rock my gypsy soul again, like way back in the days of old.

It's never too late to write a new chapter of this life.

I need to reap what I did sow.

Finger crossed! ;)
