May 2018 highlighted an important milestone in terms of changes. The perfect way to start a new chapter of my life is with a totally new blog, this time made using the 
[beautiful-jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme and the great work shared by [sysrich](https://github.com/sysrich/rootco.de-web).

I can't promise a new blog on a daily basis but I want to share the experiences, the feelings and the emotions that will guide me.

The blog will cover some topics dear to me like [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org), [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org), 
[LibreItalia](https://www.libreitalia.it) and [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org).

Have a lot of fun!
